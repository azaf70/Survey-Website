Notice:
In survies_manage.php
Answers are shown to the users only when they take the survey once. After that they can still take a survey but old answers will be displayed.
In the field where you have a field for radio buttons when you are creating questions; please leave it empty unless you are creating radio buttons.
Delete surveys don't work.


SETUP:
1. Run Create Data
2. Run about.php or sign_up.php
3. You can also sign in using 
Username = timmy and Password = secret95
Username = barryg and Password = letmein
Or you can use your sign up details. 
Please note using username = admin and Password = secret will show you more features which are not accessible to other users.


DOCUMENTATION:
1. You can sign-up now and if you type in a date bigger than todays date; you will be given a warning.
2. Once sign up is successful you can sign-in and you will be given a confirmation saying you have successfully signed in. After that by default
you will be taken to account.php where you can update and of the users details.
3. If you click on My Surveys where you can take a sample survey and see your results. You can also contribute in a poll table and see results in more
detail. Feel free to use the slider etc to see results in more depth. You are also shown two fields where you can name your survey and type in number of questions.
Once you have used all the number of questions and you still want to create an extra one just refresh ny surveys and you will be shown an extra number of question.
4. In create questions you can choose question type and you can also create radio buttons. Please use the radio field only when you are creating radio buttons.

any time you want just click on show answers.
6. Users can also update the number of questions and the name of their survey any time they want.
7. In design and analysis I have written approximately 2800 words where I deeply analyse how each feature on the website helps a user create a professional survey. I have
also added few points which are basically drawbacks of using the survey sites. I have analysed 3 different websites.
8. If you are logged in as Admin then you have more options such as editing any users details also you can edit Survey names, number of questions. You basically have more control
of the website.
